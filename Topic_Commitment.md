My white paper will be for an audience consisting of farmers that are looking for ways to improve their soil health and the science behind it. Other audience members might include gardeners that want to learn to improve soil health as well. The paper will consist of sections about tillage and planting, the effects of such practices, the relationship between microorganisms and the soil environment and the result shown in the soil health. I will try to focus significantly on the microorganism-soil health relationship as this is relatively new science.
