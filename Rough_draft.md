# Improving Soil Health

## Introduction
Soil health is important to every farmer regardless of the product they are producing whether its corn, cattle, or something else. Although, crop producers are more aware and concerned about the state of their soil. Ecology of the soil is an often-overlooked area of conservation of production resources. Farmers understand that the state of the soil is important and has effects on their production, but they often underestimate what they can do to improve soil and the effects that has on their bottom dollar. Farmers can improve their soil through changes in practices in tillage, cover crops, and microbial activity.

## Tillage Methods
### Conventional Tillage
Conventional tillage is the most commonly used method for preparing the soil for seeding. There are advantages and disadvantages to tilling the soil before every seeding. Most corn producers have more success by tilling the fields prior to planting corn. This is likely due to producers not changing their ways often. America is the largest producer of corn in the world, so a large chunk of American soil is tilled using conventional methods. There are two other methods of tillage: strip-tillage and no-tillage.

### Strip Tillage
Strip tillage is the least common and is essentially tilling right in the path of the seeder, stripping a few inches across, where it is followed by the placement of the seed into the soil. Strip-tillage is not as popular as the other two methods of tillage because of the cost of specialized equipment needed to till and plant simultaneously. Crop producers mainly use strip tillage to dry out wet soils, warm up cold soils by removing residue, fertilizer placement, and to relieve soil compaction. Strip tillage dries out wet soil by opening up six to eight inches of soil to the air resulting in drier soil. Tilling soil can increase soil temperatures. Warmer soil temperatures mean that the seed will germinate sooner. Strip tillage also allows for the near perfect placement of fertilizer next to the seed simultaneous to planting. This results in more efficient use of fertilizer, which can lower costs dramatically. This method of tillage can also relieve soil compaction by cutting through pans. This allows for less restricted root growth leading to possible higher yields.

### No-tillage
